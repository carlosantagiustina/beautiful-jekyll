title: About me
subtitle: a very short bio
---

At the present time, I am adjunct professor of Behavioural Economics at Ca' Foscari, and I collaborate to the EU project MUHAI at the Venice International University.
<br><br>
I consider myself a digital social scientist and my research approach is interdisciplinary, and data driven. I have a great passion for epistemology, information theory and social psychology.  <br><br>
My field is that of web data retrieval and modelling, with a focus on uncertainty, beliefs about risks, and causal arguments dynamics.
<br><br>
Over the past few years, I have developed multiple tools to analyse the online propagation of citizens’ opinions, the perception and social amplification of risk(s), and the diffusion of collective uncertainties. I have an extensive expertise on subjects and methods related to digital social sciences, information retrieval, network sciences, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.
<br><br>
Through research activity, I contribute to the development of information extraction and statistical modelling techniques for textual data and count time series, as well as other digital methods and intelligent interfaces. <br>
I use these tools to collect, process, and analyse large amounts of textual data from online social media and other web sources. For example, during my PhD I downloaded and analysed a corpus of millions of posts about citizens’ uncertainties from Twitter. This, to study the dynamics of uncertainty communication on social media and its relation to social, political and market phenomena.
<br><br>
 In 2017, I have been a visiting researcher at the Media Studies Department and Digital Methods Initiative of the University of Amsterdam, where I also contributed as analyst for "A Field Guide to Fake News and Other Information Disorders”.
<br><br>
 In 2019, collaborated to the design and development of Penelope opinion observatories at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Vrije Universiteit of Brussel, and later that year I conceived and set up the computational infrastructure for the ODYCCEUS Summer School, titled “AI in the Age of Big Data”.
<br><br>
 More recently, together with Matteo Iacopini and Michele Costola, I worked on the analysis of the effects on markets of public concern and risk perception using social media and search engine data.
<br><br>
  During the last year, I also contributed to the development of the AquaGranda digital community memory: a citizen science project that aims to construct a “walkable” digital archive using textual data collected from a variety of sources, ranging from webchats to online newspapers and social media. Besides contributing to the construction of this archive, I have been one of the data-scientists and artists that have transformed the contents of the digital community memory in a public (web) art exhibition.
<br><br>
  As a researcher for the MUHAI project, I am currently working on the use of ontologies and knowledge graphs for the understanding and contextualization of textual data about social inequality collected from web sources.
